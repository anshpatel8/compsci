# Computer Science portfolio
Below is a portfolio for all projects I created studying Computer Science at the University of Nottingham. This includes all courseworks, and any optional projects undertaken. Currently managed by Ansh Patel. Since I am not allowed to share direct code, I will instead provide written information of what I made and further information can be given upon request
## List of modules
### First year
 - **Maths for Computer Scientists 2** - Explored predicate logic 
 - **Databases and interfaces** - Made a website in HTML for a movie database like IMDB, where people could query the database by actor or movie name and results would be returned onto screen Explored PHP, form queuries, encrpytion and CSS here also
 - **Introduction to software engineering** - Learned about the group developement process and JUnit testing in Java and fixed Java code based on my test, as well as test driven development
 - **Funamentals of Artificial Intelligence** - Visualised search methods and some basic heuristics using Python in a Jupyter Notebook 
 - **Programming Paradigms** - Developed a fully working version of the Othello game in Java using Model View Controller programming and Swing. Also learned the basics of Haskell and recursion and solving computation problems using Haskell

### Second year
