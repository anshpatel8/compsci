# Computer Science portolia
Below is a portfolio for all projects I created studying Computer Science at the University of Nottingham. This includes all courseworks, and any optional projects undertaken. Currently managed by Ansh Patel. Since I am not allowed to share direct code, I will instead provide written information of what I made and further information can be given upon request
