# Computer Science portfolio
Below is a portfolio for all projects I created studying Computer Science at the University of Nottingham. This includes all courseworks, and any optional projects undertaken. Currently managed by Ansh Patel. Since I am not allowed to share direct code, I will instead provide written information of what I made and further information can be given upon request
## List of modules
### First year
 - **Programming and Algorithms** - Learned the basics of programming and C, and how to implement solutions to common problems and sorting algorithms and data structures
 - **Systems and Architecture** - Learned the basics of the CPU and ARM programming to make simple programs on an emulator
 - **Computer fundamentals** - Drew logic diagrams 
 - **Maths for Computer Scientists** - Explored predicate logic and matrix manipulation as well as the foundation of discrete maths
 - **Databases and interfaces** - Made a website in HTML for a movie database like IMDB, where people could query the database by actor or movie name and results would be returned onto screen Explored PHP, form queuries, encrpytion and CSS here also
 - **Introduction to software engineering** - Learned about the group developement process and JUnit testing in Java and fixed Java code based on my test, as well as test driven development
 - **Funamentals of Artificial Intelligence** - Visualised search methods and some basic heuristics using Python in a Jupyter Notebook 
 - **Programming Paradigms** - Developed a fully working version of the Othello game in Java using Model View Controller programming and Swing. Also learned the basics of Haskell and recursion and solving computation problems using Haskell

### Second year
 - **Operating systems and Concurrency** - Learned how operating systems work and made a fully functional mock CPU in C to simulate multi threaded programming with various processes and outputs
 - **Formal reasoning** - Lean prover tactics
 - **Developing Maintainable Software** - Was given a badly made project in Java and had to maintain it by refactoring it and extending it in a way that adheres to common practices
 - **Group project** - Made an android app in react native for a rowing club that wanted their members to be able to receive updates, monitor attendance and track training performace. Data was stored in a firebase database. Did the full requirements gathering process and UML diagrams
 - **Artifical Intelligence Methods** - Implemented a heuristic based solver to cycle through a few heuristics and solve a minimisation problem in Java
 - **Algorithms, data structures and efficiency** - Learned about how to measure performance of algorithms and how different data structures operate
 - **Languages and Computation** - Learned about finite automata, turing machines

### Third year
 - **Compilers** - Developed a fully working compiler for the MiniTriangle language in Haskell
 - **Mobile device programming** - Made a fully fuctioning music player like Spotify using Android Studio
 - **Communication and Collaboration Technologies** - Made a 3D interactive map of a museum that people can collaborate on to add facts about artefects using HTML and three.js
 - **Symbolic Artificial Intelligence** - Developed a Z3 and OR-Tools based solver to solve a workflow satisfiability problem and wrote a report outlining my formulations in CSP and FOL format
